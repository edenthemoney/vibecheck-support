    <div class="container">
        <p>
            Effective Date: March 8, 2025

        <p>
            Welcome to VibeCheck. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our VibeCheck application.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        
        <h3>1.1 Audio Data</h3>
        <p>
            VibeCheck requires access to your device's microphone to analyze audio in your environment. <strong>We do not record, store, or transmit any audio data</strong>. All audio processing happens locally on your device, and the raw audio data is discarded immediately after analysis.
        </p>

        <h3>1.2 Analysis Results</h3>
        <p>
            When you save analysis results, this data is stored locally on your device using Apple's UserDefaults system. This data never leaves your device and is not accessible to us or any third parties.
        </p>

        <h3>1.3 Usage Data</h3>

        <h3>1.4 Purchase Information</h3>
        <p>
            If you make in-app purchases, Apple handles all payment processing. We do not collect, store, or have access to your payment information. We only receive confirmation from Apple that a purchase has been completed.
